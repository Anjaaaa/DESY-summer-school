The high-luminosity upgrade for the LHC planned to be ready to run in 2026\todo{Which year should I put?}\ imposes new challenges on detectors. For instance, an enhanced luminosity is immediately related to elevated radiation levels which constitute heat development. To avoid a thermal runaway and ensure reliable measurements, the electronics must be held at a constant temperature\todo{How cold should it be?} which requires some kind of cooling system for all detector components. \\

\subsection{Petal}
During my time in the DESY summer school, I participated in testing the thermal performance of the inner tracking detector of the ATLAS experiment. Figure \ref{fig:ATLAS} illustrates its position within the big detector and the planned upgraded design. The parts studied at DESY are the so-called petals that are assembled perpendicularly around the beampipe to track particles with low transversal energy. Figure \ref{fig:petal} displays a picture of the tested petal prototype.\todo{Maybe without the last sentence.}

\subsection{Cooling System}
Figure \ref{fig:coolingLoop} shows a prototype of the bare cooling loop. The cooling system is based on the energy taken by a phase change. Liquid $\text{CO}_2$ is pumped into the cooling loop where some of it evaporates if exposed to heat. This evaporation takes energy (enthalpy of evaporation) which is taken from the heat source.\todo{Find better wording.}
