Following the rather detailed explanation in the foregoing sections, here is a summary of our results. \\


We did a variety of studies on the theoretical conversion between emitted IR radiation and object temperature. So far, the results are little satisfying. But, we are talking to Graham Beck and other teams involved in the inner tracker update and thermal performance tests. \\


We determined the emissivity of the paint in a range between 0.905 and 0.930. This result is coherent with our expectations but it needs to be narrowed some more to achieve a temperature uncertainty of less than \SI{1}{\degreeCelsius}. Given that the emissivity calculation is based on the conversion equation between radiant power and temperature further exploration in this direction needs to be done. \\


The camera software seems to overall give good results with some error, e.g. it overestimates the known emissivity of the tape by 0.01. \\


The petal was fully prepared for the measurements. After testing the trustworthiness of glueing the pt100s onto the Si, we successfully installed XX pt100s on the petal. Additionally, we sprayed the petal black. And even though the dried coating looks sandy, it fulfils its purpose. \\


Evtl.: First results. \\


In the future weeks, the ongoing measurements need to be analysed and evaluated. The final results are planned to be presented at the ??? in the beginning of October.
